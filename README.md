# Textorium

Textorium is a Chrome extension that lets you manage and save text snippets, prompts, ideas, and more — all locally on your device, via the extension popup. It does not inject UI into webpages; all actions happen within the popup.

## Features

- **Add and Edit Snippets**  
  Save text snippets with detailed tag information (Tag Name and Tag Category) along with titles and content.
  
- **Favorites Functionality**  
  Mark your frequently used snippets as favorites for quick access.
  
- **Search and Filter**  
  Easily search snippets by title or content, and filter by favorites.
  
- **Export/Import**  
  Export your snippets as a JSON file for backup or sharing, and import them back when needed.
  
- **Popup-Only UI**  
  Works entirely inside the extension popup without injecting scripts or UI into pages.
  
- **Responsive Design**  
  Popup layout optimized for readability; long text preserves line breaks.
